## Contributing

First, clone the repository.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pyrox18/key-collector.git
$ cd key-collector
```

**Each of us will have our own main branches to work on**, so commits should be made and pushed to your own branches only.

```bash
$ git checkout ramfromsudan-main # OR zafum5-main OR pyrox18-main
# Make some file changes
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "Change some files"
$ git push
```

Feel free to make topic branches of your own to work on as you see fit.

Once you've made enough changes and want to merge it onto the master branch, [**make a pull request on GitHub**](https://github.com/pyrox18/key-collector/pulls) for your branch to merge onto master. If there are no issues, your branch will be merged onto the master branch.

**Commit messages** must follow the standard commit message guidelines, which can be found [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). In short, commit messages must have a subject of less than 50 characters, with an optional description limited to 72 characters per line. Message subjects must be written in the imperative mood (e.g. "Add constructor method", NOT "Added constructor method" or "Adds constructor method", etc.).

As per the assignment requirements, all of the Java source files must have comments in them to state the contributors to the file and to explain what the code does. In favour of standardisation, **all comments should be written according to the [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) style**.
